#### <center>Ram Varra</center>



### Overview
This  workshop series is targeted to provide a practical hands-on approach for learning
Machine Learning Artificial Intelligence in Python using  - `scikit.learn`, `keras`
and `tensorflow`.

These are suitable for folks that have knowledge of Python and not meant for conceptual or theoritical level study.  I will be focusing on practical aspects of using AI/ML for people interested in applying in real-world use cases.  I will be using publicly availble resources for explaining the concepts, but with main focus on hands-on demonstration of using the tools for solving the problems.

### Format and Duration

The sessions will be twice a week, 1 hour online Skype Meeting sessions.

- Tuesday afternoon 1-2 PST
- Friday afternoon  2-3 PST

The session videos will be recorded and posted for future use for folks to catchup missed sessions.  I expect to carry these for about 2 quarters of elapsed duration, The duration may vary based on level of interest and pace of the participants and my available time.


### Prerquisites
The workshops will be in hands-on format in Python and expect that the participants have following background knowledge.

- Strong proficiency in Python programming. I will be using Jupyter notebook tool with Python 3.6 version for the workshops.  You should have a working environment with [Anaconda Python 64 bit](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) installed for these sessions.
- Intermediate level knowledge of data ananlysis and visualization with `numpy`, `pandas` and `matplotlib`
- Basic knowledge of Statistics

I will not be covering the Python programming or `numpy`/`pandas`/`matplotlib` in the basics in these workshops.

### Enrollment
No formal enrollment is required. I will update this document with Skype meeting information.  The actual sequencing of topics covered will vary in the workshops. I will be introducing topics at differing level of detail through the course progression.
