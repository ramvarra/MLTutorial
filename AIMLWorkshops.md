#### <center>Ram Varra</center>



### Overview
This  workshop series is intended to provide a practical hands-on approach for
Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence using Python `scikit.learn`, `Tensorflow`, `Keras`

These are suitable for folks that have knowledge of Python and looking for implementing AI/ML algorithms.  I will be focusing on practical aspects of using AI/ML in real-world use cases.  I will be providing the concepts and intuition behind the algorithms, but  main focus will be hands-on practice of using the tools for solving the problems.

### Format and Duration

The sessions will be twice a week, 1 hour online Skype Meetings.

- Tuesday afternoon 1-2 PST
- Friday afternoon  2-3 PST

The session videos will be recorded and posted for future use or for folks to catch-up missed sessions.  I expect to carry these for about 2 quarters. The duration may vary based on level of interest, pace of the participants and my available time.


### Prerequisites
The workshops will be in hands-on format in Python and expect that the participants have following background knowledge.

- Strong proficiency in Python programming. I will be using Jupyter notebook tool with Python 3.6 version for the workshops.  You should have a working environment with [Anaconda Python 64 bit](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) installed for these sessions.
- Intermediate level knowledge of data analysis  and visualization with `numpy`, `pandas` and `matplotlib`
- Basic knowledge of Statistics

I will not be covering the Python programming or `numpy`/`pandas`/`matplotlib` basics in these workshops.
